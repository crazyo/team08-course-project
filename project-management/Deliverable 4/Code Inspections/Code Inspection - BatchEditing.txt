Code inspection on BatchEditing
Reviewer: Xufeng Wang
Plug-in under review: BatchEditing
Date: Nov. 10

Note: Since the functionality is not fully implemented yet, the code review was
      done on the existing code that was quite messy
Bug #1 - Incorrect dialog option from leftover testing code
    Description: When fire up the batch-editing dialog, there is a fake tag
                 named "test". It is very likely to be caused by testing code
                 that was not deleted.
Style issue #1 - No documentation
Style issue #2 - Bad indentations and empty lines
Style issue #3 - Unused variables and testing code was not deleted
