	- When user clicks this button they will be taken to new window for creating citation

2. Display all fields for selected item
	- Items field names are shown in a drop down list

3. Create citation based on fields selected
	- Can select fields and show values along with field names
	- Can place seperators to customize output

4. Save new citation
	- Can save citation locally as a csl file
	- Can now install new csl and use same way as every other citation style

	  same way they would save any other file since they now have the csl.
